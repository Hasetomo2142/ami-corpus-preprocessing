A;0:23:47.430000;0:24:13.040000;Okay, we need to talk about our functions and our target group. We need to decide who our target group is. You um in your analysis of different market um of the marketing, you identified that different groups wanted different things or had certain preferences, for example that um that older people didn't really care for um voice recognition, but younger people did. Um and so who are we aiming this at?;user target group;Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion,Inform,Stall,Suggest;;Open issue;S/1,S/4,S/7;

B;0:24:16.000000;0:24:27.770000;Well if we're gonna say that function um fashion we put the fashion in in electronics then you automatically, I think, a sort of younger group that that's who's gonna be attracted to this.;user target group;Inform,Stall;;Statement;S/2;T/1/Option
D;0:24:29.780000;0:24:33.080000;Yes, I do think, who's gonna have the money to buy that also, that one?;user target group;Elicit-Inform,Stall;;Yes/No issue;S/3;T/2/Request

C;0:24:41.460000;0:24:49.420000;Is it is it something that's gonna be sold separately from the television or is it something that comes w with a television? 'Cause that would affect the way that we market it.;user target group;Elicit-Inform,Inform;;A/B issue;S/5;T/4/Request
A;0:24:50.120000;0:24:59.790000;Well at least right now what we're doing is um deciding on just the remote itself, so it will probably be sold separately, twenty five Euro by itself.;user target group;Inform,Stall;;Statement;S/6;T/5/Option

D;0:25:00.080000;0:25:25.160000;The only break-down that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation and basically there's a big jump, after thirty five people don't really care if it has voice, so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that's a good idea. I dunno I'm gonna be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later, but if that's sort of the only quality that we have that is divided into age then we would wanna stick between the fifteen and thirty five range.;user target group;Inform,Suggest;;Statement;S/8;T/7/Option
B;0:25:25.700000;0:25:35.050000;Yeah, that's probably uh a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway, so that might be a fairly good target group for us.;user target group;Assess,Inform,Suggest;;Statement;S/9;T/8/Positive
