I know what  because it's on the television. The television tells me what channel it's on when I change it. So  I don't know that really that's that's gonna be a a d problem, 'cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push of a button. Okay ? So ca can we can we create that kind of interface within a scroll system ?"
